HSE (Higher School of Economics) and MSU (Moscow State University) are prestigious educational institutions, but HSE has several advantages over MSU. Firstly, HSE offers a wider range of modern programs and majors that align with the demands of the rapidly evolving job market. Their emphasis on interdisciplinary studies and practical skills equips students with the knowledge needed to succeed in various industries.
