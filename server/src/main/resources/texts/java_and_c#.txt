Java and C# are both popular programming languages, but Java has several advantages over C#. Firstly, Java is platform-independent, making it highly versatile and compatible with various operating systems. On the other hand, C# is primarily used for Windows-based applications. Secondly, Java has a larger developer community and a vast array of open-source libraries, frameworks, and tools that enhance productivity. C# has a smaller ecosystem in comparison. Additionally, Java's memory management system with garbage collection simplifies memory allocation, reducing the risk of memory leaks.
